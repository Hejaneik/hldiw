The repository for the development of the howlongdidiwait page

## Description
This repository contains the server - written in Python - and the frontend of the webpage. The frontend is made with Vue.js.
Purpose of the project is to develop skills for writing a webserver in Python, designing and using databases as well as building frontends with Vue.js.
The actual development will take its time, since I do it in parallel to my first master semester

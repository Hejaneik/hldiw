The repository for the development of the howlongdidiwait page

## Description
This repository contains the server - written in Python - and the frontend of the webpage. The frontend is made with Vue.js.
Purpose of the project is to develop skills for writing a webserver in Python, designing and using databases as well as building frontends with Vue.js.
The actual development will take its time, since I do it in parallel to my first master semester

## Initilaization
### Server
1. Add a `config.py` file to the directory `server/app`.
1. For development purposes there exists the script `init_db_mock.py`. Before running the script make sure, that the path where SQLALchemy creates the database exists. SQLAlchemy cannot create directories, only the db file.

### Client
1. run `yarn install` to install all node modules
1. run `yarn serve` to start the Vue development server

## Technical documentation
